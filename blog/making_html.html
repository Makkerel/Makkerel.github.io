            <h1>Making a Website with No Frameworks</h1>
            <time datetime="2024-12-20">December 20, 2024</time>
            <p>Making a website on the internet nowadays seems quite difficult without some tools to really help you get started. There are a lot of websites that have the primary goal helping you make websites. 
                Websites like Wix.com and Squarespace seemingly giving you a quick way to make a good website fast.
                They even have a bunch of other services for these websites that may be useful for professionals. However, these websites kind of abstract away what is really happening and somewhat ties you to their platform. 
                If you really want to learn how to make a website from scratch you&#39;re gonna need to program some html,css, and javascript. 
                This blog will be about writing a static website meaning that you will not really gonna have anything like user accounts which are too advanced for this blog. 
                I will be talking about a super easy way to host a static website and some tips on programming the website.</p>
            <h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
            <p>To get started you&#39;re gonna need you&#39;re gonna need three things a GitHub account, git, and a code editor. 
                The GitHub account is allows you to create a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which is a free way to actually host your static website on the internet. 
                Also if you ever want to do more programming in the future a GitHub account will practically be necessary.
                 The code editor I recommend is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Vscode</a> as it has a lot of support for html, css, and javascript out of the box and integration with git that will be useful for GitHub pages. 
                 Git is far more useful than what we&#39;re gonna use for this project but in this case it will just help us upload to GitHub.</p>
            <h3 id="git">Git</h3>
            <p>Once you have made a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> the next thing to do is to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a> and configure it. 
                When installing just use all default options. Now you must configure git so that it is connected to your GitHub account. 
                Open git bash on Windows or terminal on macOS and set this:</p>
            <div class="code_block"><code class="language-shell">git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;</code></div>
            <p>This will set your user name in git that can be anything. 
                This username is completely different from your username on GitHub and does not have to be the same. 
                Make sure you have quotation marks to make sure it works. Now comes the more important part.</p>
            <div class="code_block"><code class="language-shell">git config --global user.email emailgithub@email.com</code></div>
            <p>You <strong>must</strong> set this with the same email that you used to create your github account. 
                It is how the git on your computer knows which GitHub account to tie your local to. You can check if you did both correct with:</p>
            <div class="code_block"><code class="language-shell">git config --global user.name<br>git config --global user.email</code></div>
            <p>The output for both is what you put originally then you are fine.</p>
            <h3 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h3>
            <p>Now you should be able to follow the short guide on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. 
                If you are on windows make sure to do all the terminal instructions on Git Bash. If everything works you should now have your very own personal static website that you will be able to modify. </p>
            <h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>
            <p>Once you have VSCode installed you should be able to just open the folder the contains your git repo. 
                The name of the folder should be called <code>yourusername.github.io</code> unless you have decided to change it. 
                If there is a popup on whether to trust the authors just click yet to to trusting the authors since the author is you. 
                Furthermore, there is a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview">GitHub tab</a> which gives you a really nice UI for committing and pushing your changes to Github. 
                The setup is now complete.</p>
            <h2 id="the-html">The Html</h2>
            <p>To really create any website you&#39;re gonna need some knowledge of html. I highly recommend learning html, css, and javascript from the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Odin Project</a>. 
                I will not be teaching html here but I will give a couple tips on getting started. There are two main types of websites being either one long page or a collection of shorter pages. 
                If you want a personal blog like me then multiple pages make much more sense but if your website is mean to be a personal portfolio type of website then a long one pager might be better. 
                If you are doing multiple pages I recommend making some templates for certain types of pages that you might want to reuse. For example I have template I use for every blog that I post.</p>
            <h2 id="the-css">The CSS</h2>
            <p>This is in my opinion the part that will demonstrate the most creativity. Many people find CSS to be somewhat difficult at first and even annoying(which it sometimes is) but in general it is a very robust language to use. 
                It allows your website to be unique and by mastering it can help you create some truly amazing content. 
                I personally mess around with CSS the most as it is in my opinion often the most fun to create animations and change layouts. 
                The best documentation for css is definitely <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">Mozilla Docs</a> which will help you for any question about properties. </p>
            <h2 id="the-javascript">The Javascript</h2>
            <p>You have probably heard about this language regarding practically any discussion of website creation. 
                Funnily enough if you choose to become a programmer you will probably never you raw javascript in a job but it is the foundation for all the libraries and frameworks that are built on top of it like React, Vue, or Angular. 
                You can use as much or as little javascript as you like for your website based one how much you like the language or what you want to do with your website. 
                I will say that a lot of stuff you can do with just html and css but eventually you will be required to use it if you want things like search. 
                Additionally, if you ever want a non static website with users, notifications, comments you will need javascript.</p>
            <h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
            <p>You now have a base to work on and a website on the internet now the only thing left is to go and create whatever you desire and upload it for the internet to see. 
                There is so much more to websites than what I have just described but I hope this served as a nice takeoff for anyone that wanted to make a website. 
                I personally still have a lot I want to do with my own website.</p>
