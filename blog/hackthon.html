            <h1 id="going-to-a-hackathon">Going to a Hackathon</h1>
            <time datetime="2025-01-16">January 16, 2025</time>
            <p>I went to <a href="https://sb-hacks-xi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover">SBHacks XI</a> which was the first ever hackathon have ever participated in. 
                I went with 3 other guys and that was my team for the hackathon. 
                They all taught me brand new things about programming that I had no idea of until the hackathon. 
                In general the hackathon really opened my eyes to how much I really needed to learn. 
                It was 24 hours of pretty much just programming and the fun I had was something I had not expected</p>
            <h2 id="the-actual-project">The Actual Project</h2>
            <p>We decided to create a housing app for our school UCSB. The housing app would be an aggregate of all the listed housing around Isla Vista that could be found from different websites. 
                As such there were two major parts to this project that we really wanted to perfect the frontend user interface and the way we were able to get our information. </p>
            <h3 id="the-backend">The Backend</h3>
            <p>The aggregation technique we used was an AI powered web scraper that used 3 main technologies that would link together to form a pipeline that would generate CSV files of housing information for us. 
                The first technology used was Selenium which allowed us to simulate a browser where we would then take screen shots of the pages on different housing apps. 
                After taking the screenshot the image would then be fed into a software called Sycamore made by one of the sponsors of the Hackathon Aryn AI. 
                Sycamore would then parse thought the screenshots and create CSV files from the images. Finally the CSVs would be fed through Claude.AI to remove any errors in the CSVs. 
                This information would be then sent from out backend Django server into our frontend.</p>
            <h3 id="the-frontend">The Frontend</h3>
            <p>The Frontend was really not that difficult to implement aside from the fact that we decided to used Svelte and Sveltekit as our frontend framework. 
                We decided on this because one of our team members believed it to be the best for the fast pace of a hackathon compared to something like React. 
                I had to pretty much learn it as I went and I was quite the interesting experience working with a framework that was much less verbose than React. 
                I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it and will probably be using it in the future. 
                The actual frontend was in many ways just a more focused version of google maps but it did look really nice. 
                The actual project can be seen on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/homelessgaucho">Devpost</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="the-challenges">The Challenges</h2>
            <p>By far the most difficult thing about the hackathon was learning the new technologies that I was just not at all experience with. 
                From simply installing the software to actually using it I was met with a whole host of difficulties. 
                The way everything was setup I had to install a package manager called Scoop for Windows that I had no knowledge of until that day and it has really improved my Windows experience ever since. 
                From Scoop I would then need to install a package manager for JavaScript technologies called pnpm. This was literally just for the installation of Svelte and Sveltekit.
                However, even though it was hard I now know of some great useful tech for the future. 
                I also learned about front and backends and how the connect with each other a lot better now and even learned that there is a new Python package manager called uv. </p>
            <h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Our team finished the hack around 4:30 am in the morning and I was so completely out of it but I had to get up at around 8 to head in to start doing demoes and try to win a prize. 
                My teammates didn&#39;t show up at first and I pretty much had to deal with all the logistics of the project by myself.
                 We were lucky in that we demoed a lot later than some other teams which gave time for one of my teammates to show up. 
                 In the end we won an award of 500$ for best use of Aryn AI Software. After the hackathon I slept for about 4 hours in the afternoon. 
                 I really enjoyed my time and will probably try to go to another hackathon in the future. 
                 I thought it was gonna be constant coding for the 24 hours but it was actually much more chill. 
                 We coded and talked and learned all at the same time. I highly recommend SBHacks to anyone that may be looking to participate in a hackathon as well. 
                 The hosts were great and the environment welcoming. All I can say is 10/10 would hack again.</p>
