            <time datetime="2024-01-03"></time>
            <p>Core Keeper is a somewhat new game that was fully released on August 27, 2024. 
                The game is a available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/">Steam</a> and is a top down survival game that is similar in genre to games like Terraria. 
                I recently finished the game with a friend after about a week and will give a short overview about the good and the bad and whether you should buy.</p>
            <h2 id="the_pros">The Pros</h2>
            <p>In general if you have experience with survival games this game is not to hard to get into. There are starter classes that allow you to kickstart your run and make the very beginning go faster. 
                The skills that you develop over time is quite nice. 
                The progression feels very smooth and I can tell the developers put great care into making sure you feel like you are getting stronger over time at a good pace throughout the early, middle, and end game. 
                I'll now talk about the specific parts that I really enjoyed.</p>
            <h3 id="the_builds">The Builds</h3>
            <p>I really enjoyed build crafting in this game a lot more than I would say even a game like Terraria. 
                The reason for the build crafting to be better is a fundamental difference in how progression works with regards to items. 
                You can upgrade items over time so that you never have to change the armor you wear at any point in the game. 
                Of course items that are earned later in the game usually have more powerful effects and are by default higher level but that does not detract from the fact that you can stick with the same set of items that you get from the very beginning. 
                This singular change allowed the developers to create really interesting items that focus of different stats.
                For example, by the time I beat the game I had three different extremely strong builds with one focusing entirely on melee damage and healing, attack speed, and dodge chance. 
                My favorite being the dodge change build because I allowed me to be practically immortal as I would dodge 90% of all attacks from enemies. 
                The variety of builds really extended the amount of time I put into the game as I searched for the best items for my builds.</p>
            <h3 id="the_environments">The Environments</h3>
            <p>The different biomes and scenes are quite good. It starts out pretty basic but over time you get more interesting biomes with each biome have its own mini biomes that I greatly enjoyed. There are fungi, larva, and crystal biomes that are all very unique. The sea biome is by far my favorite with the ost that plays during it being the nicest to listen to in my opinion.</p>
            <h3 id="the-bosses">The Bosses</h3>
            <p>The approach to boss design is quite special and different from any other survival game that I have played. 
                Many bosses do not need to be spawned and instead move around the map where you have to track and then kill them. 
                The resummoning for these bosses are also quite easy and you can even craft trackers to automatically find the boss and if it moves track it with a marker. 
                The mechanics for most of the bosses are quite unique as well but I won&#39;t spoil any of that. </p>
            <h2 id="the-cons">The Cons</h2>
            <p>While I enjoyed this game a lot there are a couple of major problems I have with this game that can be a massive problem. 
                I played with a friend and we even had a couple of quality of life mods in order to not be rage quitting the game out of annoyance. </p>
            <h3 id="the-tedium">The Tedium</h3>
            <p>By far the biggest issue with this game is the tedium to some of its mechanics make no sense. 
                By default you lose all your items on death which is just very annoying simply because of how hard it is to get the items back later into the game. 
                In general I would say it is a skill issue but as you progress you go farther and farther away from the core which means that if you die you will now spend the next few minutes just trying to get your items back. 
                Also unlike a game of Minecraft where it can actually be quite difficult to die later into the game the enemies later into the game do a lot damage to a point where you day within a second without being able to anything. 
                Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier the more you progress in the game the farther you move from the core and while you do have teleporters it does not help enough when it comes to exploring the edges of the map because it can take an annoying amount of time to get to the edge of the map.
                I would really like better movement and mining in this game as you progress.</p>
            <h3 id="waiting-times">Waiting Times</h3>
            <p>All the smelting, cooking, and some of the bosses require you to way awhile to get the metals, meals, and bosses you want. 
                This mechanic just makes no sense to me in a game like this especially the required wait times for many of the bosses. 
                Why do I have to wait 5 minutes to fight the boss again. 
                The smelting and cooking problem can be solved by making a lot of cooking pots or forges however that introduces the annoyance of having to go and walk up to my 12 different forges in order to get my metal in order to craft. </p>
            <h3 id="the-wiki-problem">The Wiki Problem</h3>
            <p>I'm not gonna lie that Terraria is by far the worst when it comes to this problem but this game also has this issue but to a lesser extent where there are a bunch of things in the game I would just have no idea about if I did not have access to the of the game. 
                It is not that big of an issue compared to Terraria but it is there. </p>
            <h2 id="should-you-buy-the-game">Should You Buy The Game?</h2>
            <p>This is the big question and I think if you have a friend or friends to play it with this is definitely well worth the money. 
                You can fix many of the quality of life issues with some mods and having a friend allows you to explore more of the map much more quickly. 
                If you want to play by yourself I would say it is much more slow and in my opinion much less fun. 
                In general though it is still a great experience and even with the tedium does not require crazy amounts of time or skill to get through the game. 
                The builds by themselves can sustain some people and since there is mod support there are truly infinite possibilities with this game. 
                So my answer to this question is Yes if you have friend that can play with you and if you are by yourself only if you can look past the tedium that I have just described or like to play with mods. </p>
