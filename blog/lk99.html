                    LK-99 And The Unknown Side of Science
                </h1>
                <time datetime="2025-03-18">March 18, 2025</time>
                <p>
                    Around midnight on Friday, July 21st, 2023 a paper was
                    uploaded to <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a> an
                    online archive of research papers. I was probably sleeping
                    at the time and an event like this was nothing unusual. It
                    was not published anywhere and the authors were not well
                    known. No one should have cared about this preprint and yet
                    the entire world would soon be driven into frenzy. Why?
                    Because it claimed to have discovered the holy grail of
                    material science, a room temperature superconductor called
                    LK-99. In the simplest terms, the paper was claiming the new
                    material would be in essence a replacement for copper.
                    Superconductors are materials that perfectly conduct
                    electricity unlike a material like copper which will lose a
                    bit of the electricity as it passes through. Pretty much all
                    electronics would become more efficient with a room
                    temperature superconductor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By Wednesday of the following week, all my social media from
                    Reddit to Twitter had someone talking about LK-99. One tweet
                    had over 3 Million Views! Maybe it was the release of
                    ChatGPT months earlier or just the desire for change due to
                    the pandemic but it was this discovery that transfixed the
                    public like few had before. Yet the claim of this
                    superconductor was unproven and quickly started the
                    rollercoaster that was the scientists from around the world
                    scrambling to replicate the findings of the paper.

                    Major national and university laboratories rushed to be the
                    first to confirm the findings. The Wikipedia page for LK-99
                    even had an entire section that was being updated to show
                    the status of replication for different labs. This entire
                    situation, to put it lightly, was odd as usually, labs would
                    patiently wait on one another or until the paper was
                    actually properly published but here it felt like a
                    competition. The reason for this was the fact that based on
                    the paper it felt that anyone and their grandma could
                    seemingly reproduce LK-99. The process outlined was almost
                    too simple and only needed copper phosphate and lead sulfate
                    which many scientists already had lying around their lab.
                    Some more chemically savvy public members even announced
                    that they would attempt to DIY the material by themselves
                    within their homes. Some of these DIYers would stream or
                    tweet their progress online for all the world to witness.

                    Indeed the draw of LK-99 was that it was cheap and a room
                    temperature superconductor. It was so simple to make that
                    many scientists felt wrong to not at least attempt to
                    replicate the findings. The public&#39;s desires for results
                    were answered when on August 1st, 2023 a video on the
                    Chinese social media platform BiliBili showed what was
                    claimed to be
                    <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14p4y1V7kS/"
                        >LK-99 levitating</a
                    >. Levitation is a sign of the Meisner effect where it
                    expels all magnetic fields causing levitation above magnets.
                    This effect is a property of all superconducting materials
                    but is not unique to superconductors. The levitation of
                    LK-99 would change public sentiment from skepticism to faith
                    as it felt more real than ever. However, it was not all
                    sunshine and rainbows as buried within the maelstrom of
                    posts on the levitation were the troubling posts of LK-99
                    being a facade of superconductivity. The hype though would
                    prevent these revelations from gaining traction for quite
                    some time.

                    The floating rock was enough for the public to be convinced
                    and I don&#39;t blame them because the effect was straight
                    out of science fiction and it didn&#39;t help the discourse
                    promoted the idea that it was a silver bullet. After the
                    first week of August not a single lab showed an abrupt drop
                    to 0 electrical resistance. Electrical Resistance is
                    generally just how well an object can conduct electricity
                    and a sudden drop to 0 resistance is what defines a
                    superconductor. The hope of the public waned as no
                    conclusive evidence was published. The final nail in
                    LK-99&#39;s coffin came on August 16th, 2023 in an
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02585-7"
                        >article by Nature</a
                    >
                    that showed it was not a superconductor. LK-99 was an
                    insulator or a material that actively stops electricity from
                    being conducted through it. The reason that it was thought
                    to be a superconductor was because it contained impurities
                    from the creation process causing the superconductive
                    effects and the inconsistent results from different labs. It
                    was fool&#39;s gold for material scientists that resolved
                    quite anticlimactically.

                    So it was all a misunderstanding from a paper that
                    hadn&#39;t even gone through peer review right? Science for
                    the public is about the big discoveries and this discovery
                    was simply a dud but there are far more beneath the surface
                    left to uncover. The true story of LK-99 lies not in the
                    material but in the people behind it. While it cannot be
                    proven to be malicious the graphs in the paper from the very
                    beginning were suspect and the actions of the authors
                    throughout are strange. Questions arise like why would a
                    scientist fake findings or claim a lie? What is the point of
                    risking your reputation by bypassing the normal process?
                    What is the normal process? The partial answer lies in the
                    system in which papers are selected and published and it all
                    starts with an innocent question of who uploaded the paper
                    anyway.

                <p>
                    The two major scientists for LK-99 are Sukbae Lee and Jihoon
                    Kim whose initials are where the material&#39;s name is
                    derived from. However, these two people, while both being
                    the first authors or the primary people behind the paper,
                    were not the ones who uploaded the paper. The situation is
                    strange as there were two papers uploaded to Arxiv about
                    LK-99 but the papers were completely different. The first
                    paper that caused the initial hype was uploaded by Young-Wan
                    Kwon while the
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037v1"
                        >second paper</a
                    >
                    uploaded by Hyuntak Kim doesn&#39;t even include Kwon as an
                    author.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is completely normal to edit and change papers before
                    being published but having two completely different papers
                    from one another that don&#39;t even have the same authors
                    is extremely unusual. Hyuntak Kim even said the first paper
                    by Kwon was uploaded without his permission and had many
                    defects. Kwon&#39;s motivations remain unclear but from the
                    outside, it feels that Kwon was trying to steal a bit of the
                    acknowledgement by having his name on it compared to the
                    other paper. No matter the reason this is not proper conduct
                    whatsoever and casts doubt on the entire discovery if the
                    researchers can&#39;t even get the authors straight. Aside
                    from the upload oddity, the graphs in the second version
                    uploaded by Hyuntak Kim also have defects.

                <p>
                    According to Professor Philip Moriarty from the YouTube
                    channel
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl-AgmoZ5mo"
                        >Sixty Symbols</a
                    >
                    the presentation of data is almost laughable. In the graph
                    above the units on the y-axis are too big to show 0
                    resistivity of LK-99. He pointed out how even a &quot;first
                    year physics textbook&quot; would tell you the units should
                    have been 10^-8 cm, not 10^-2 cm. Furthermore, a
                    superconductor is supposed to have a sudden drop to a
                    resistance of 0 that the graph doesn&#39;t actually show and
                    instead shows a slow eventual drop to what seems to be 0.
                    The odd drop-off is already strange but the wrong units are
                    just unacceptable for a paper done by researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The authors promised to fix the mistakes and claimed better
                    results that proved without a doubt it is a room temperature
                    superconductor but it&#39;s 2025 and their promise has still
                    not materialized. The consensus on this debacle is that they
                    should&#39;ve just had the paper published and gone through
                    peer review. The answer is always apparently just peer
                    review but why is it so important and would it have
                    prevented LK-99 from happening?

                    What&#39;s the Deal with Peer Review?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The common solution that every scientist comes up with when
                    it comes to cases like LK-99 is to just not care about
                    papers until it has been properly peer reviewed and
                    published in some scientific journal. Peer review is always
                    thrown around as the answer and is considered fundamental to
                    the scientific system but surprisingly this process is not
                    as clearly defined as one would think. Generally speaking
                    peer review is where a paper is thoroughly checked and
                    vetted by another scientist working in the same field. The
                    scientist would then say if the paper is indeed good or if
                    it needs edits. Simple right?
                </p>

                    This definition is on the surface reasonable but there is no
                    clear ruleset for peer review. The matter is instead decided
                    by the journal that would publish the paper. In

                    a well known scientific journal, the editors will first pick
                    the papers that seem to be most intriguing, and then once
                    selected the editor will choose scientists to peer review
                    the paper. There are usually 2-3 reviewers and all of them
                    are volunteers not paid by Nature. The editor gets to make
                    all the decisions regarding who to send it to and the
                    reviewers stay anonymous unless they willingly reveal
                    themselves. After receiving feedback the editor will make a
                    final decision on whether to publish or not. It&#39;s clear
                    that for a process so core to the scientific system it feels
                    oddly unscientific and arbitrary.

                    According to a

                    by Jonathan P. Tennant and Tony Ross-Hellauer there is very
                    little scientific research done on peer review. The paper
                    concludes that many aspects of peer review don&#39;t have
                    enough scientific data to support or undermine them.
                    Worryingly, the paper also points out how peer review often
                    feels like a black box where what exactly happens during
                    peer review is unclear. There are no rulesets for everyone
                    to follow and journals are free to change practically
                    anything they want. The situation worsens as the job of peer
                    review is extremely undervalued and scientists that do the
                    reviews may not have the baseline skills necessary to
                    conduct a proper review.

                    In fact, LK-99 may be a demonstration of the issues with the
                    inconsistency of peer review. According to the
                    <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/366/0000920152"
                        >Sukbae Lee</a

                    one of the main authors did try to publish their findings in
                    Nature but were required to publish in another specialized
                    journal. Lee then subsequently had it published in a
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061"
                        >domestic academic journal</a
                    >
                    in April before the initial uploads to Arxiv. This means
                    that LK-99 did have peer review but it wasn&#39;t able to
                    prevent the event from occurring. While I am speculating,
                    the shoddy peer review may have given Kwon the confidence to
                    upload that first paper on Arxiv. This case illustrates that
                    not all peer review is created equal which begs the
                    question, how can peer review be improved so it is the
                    answer to cases like LK-99.

                    The question of how to fix these problems has no clear
                    answer but there are a couple of fundamental reforms that I
                    think need to happen to improve the system. The peer review
                    study believes that there needs to be more rigorous research
                    done on peer review. I agree that peer review should not be
                    put on a pedestal and needs to be an established field of
                    research just like other topics in science. I also think
                    that peer review should be disconnected from journals where
                    every journal has to follow a core set of rules for peer
                    review. In this way, I feel that peer review won&#39;t have
                    to feel as much like a black box as it currently does.

                    These are only some possible changes and other suggestions
                    may be even more effective but my point is to draw attention
                    to the fact that there are holes in the current established
                    system that should not be ignored. Science is an iterative
                    process and that includes the way science is conducted
                    itself. Hopefully, in the future, the process will be so
                    refined that when there is a new LK-99 people won&#39;t have
                    to be skeptical and instead simply be ecstatic.
