                    LK-99 And The Unknown Side of Science
                </h1>
                <time datetime="2025-03-18">March 18, 2025</time>
                <p>
                    Around midnight on Friday, July 21st, 2023 a paper was
                    uploaded to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008/">arxiv.org</a> an
                    online archive of research papers. I was probably sleeping
                    at the time and an event like this was nothing unusual. It
                    was not published anywhere and the authors were not well
                    known. No one should have cared about this preprint and yet
                    the entire world would soon be driven into frenzy. Why?
                    Because it claimed to have discovered the holy grail of
                    material science, a room temperature superconductor called
                    LK-99. In the simplest terms, the paper was claiming the new
                    material would be in essence a replacement for copper.
                    Superconductors are materials that perfectly conduct
                    electricity unlike a material like copper which will lose a
                    bit of the electricity as it passes through. Pretty much all
                    electronics would become more efficient with a room
                    temperature superconductor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By Wednesday the following week, all my social media from
                    Reddit to Twitter had someone talking about LK-99. One tweet
                    had over 3 Million Views! Maybe it was the release of
                    ChatGPT months earlier or just the desire for change due to
                    the pandemic but it was this discovery that transfixed the
                    public like few had before. Yet the claim of this
                    superconductor was unproven and quickly started the
                    rollercoaster that was the scientists from around the world
                    scrambling to replicate the findings of the paper.

                    Major national and university laboratories rushed to be the
                    first to confirm the findings. The Wikipedia page for LK-99
                    even had an entire section that was being updated to show
                    the status of replication for different labs. This entire
                    situation, to put it lightly, was odd as usually, labs would
                    patiently wait on one another or until the paper was
                    actually properly published but here it felt like a
                    competition. The reason for this was the fact that based on
                    the paper it felt that anyone and their grandma could
                    seemingly reproduce LK-99. The process outlined was almost
                    too simple and only needed copper phosphate and lead sulfate
                    which many scientists already had lying around their lab.
                    Some more chemically savvy public members even announced
                    that they would attempt to DIY the material by themselves
                    within their homes. Some of these DIYers would stream or
                    tweet their progress online for all the world to witness.

                <p>
                    Indeed the draw of LK-99 was that it was cheap and a room
                    temperature superconductor. It was so simple to make that
                    many scientists felt wrong to not at least attempt to
                    replicate the findings. The public&#39;s desires for results
                    were answered when on August 1st, 2023 a video on the
                    Chinese social media platform BiliBili showed what was
                    claimed to be
                    <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14p4y1V7kS/"
                        >LK-99 levitating</a
                    >. Levitation is a sign of the Meisner effect where it
                    expels all magnetic fields causing levitation above magnets.
                    This effect is a property of all superconducting materials
                    but is not unique to superconductors. The levitation of
                    LK-99 would change public sentiment from skepticism to faith
                    as it felt more real than ever. However, it was not all
                    sunshine and rainbows as buried within the maelstrom of
                    posts on the levitation were the troubling posts of LK-99
                    being a facade of superconductivity. The hype though would
                    prevent these revelations from gaining traction for quite
                    some time.

                    The floating rock was enough for the public to be convinced
                    and I don&#39;t blame them because the effect was straight
                    out of science fiction and it didn&#39;t help the discourse
                    promoted the idea that it was a silver bullet. After the
                    first week of August not a single lab showed an abrupt drop
                    to 0 electrical resistance. Electrical Resistance is
                    generally just how well an object can conduct electricity
                    and a sudden drop to 0 resistance is what defines a
                    superconductor. The hope of the public waned as no
                    conclusive evidence was published. The final nail in
                    LK-99&#39;s coffin came on August 16th, 2023 in an
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02585-7"
                        >article by Nature</a
                    >
                    that showed it was not a superconductor. LK-99 was an
                    insulator or a material that actively stops electricity from
                    being conducted through it. The reason that it was thought
                    to be a superconductor was because it contained impurities
                    from the creation process causing the superconductive
                    effects and the inconsistent results from different labs. It
                    was fool&#39;s gold for material scientists that resolved
                    quite anticlimactically.
                </p>
                <p>So it was all a misunderstanding from a paper that hadn&#39;t 
                    even gone through peer review right? Science for the public is about the
                     big discoveries and this discovery was simply a dud but there are far more beneath the surface left to uncover. 
                     The true story of LK-99 lies not in the material but the people behind it. 
                     While it cannot be proven to be malicious, from the very beginning the authors&#39; actions and the data presented were suspect. 
                     Questions arise like why would a scientist fake findings or claim a lie? 
                     What is the point of risking your reputation by uploading it to Arxiv? 
                     What is the proper process?
                      The partial answer lies in the system in which papers are selected and published and it all starts with the question of who uploaded to Arxiv anyway.</p>
                <h2 id="misconduct-or-mistake">Misconduct or Mistake?</h2>
                <p>The two major scientists for LK-99 are Sukbae Lee and Jihoon Kim whose initials are where the material&#39;s 
                    name is derived from. However, these two people, while both being the first authors or the primary people behind the paper, 
                    were not the ones who uploaded the paper. The situation is strange as there were two papers uploaded to Arxiv about LK-99 but the papers were completely different. 
                    The first paper that caused the initial hype was uploaded by Young-Wan Kwon while the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037v1">second paper</a> uploaded after 
                    the first by Hyuntak Kim doesn&#39;t even include Kwon as an author. </p>
                <p>It is completely normal to edit papers before being published but having two completely different papers from one another that don&#39;t even have the same authors 
                    is extremely unusual. Hyuntak Kim even said the first paper by Kwon was uploaded without his permission and had many defects. 
                    Kwon&#39;s true motivations may never be known but from the outside, it feels that Kwon was trying to steal a bit of the acknowledgement 
                    by having his name on it compared to the other paper. No matter the reason this is not proper conduct whatsoever and casts doubt on the 
                    entire discovery if the researchers can&#39;t even get the authors straight. Aside from the upload oddity, 
                    the graphs in the second version uploaded by Hyuntak Kim also have defects.</p>

                <span class="source_info"><i>Graph From <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037v1">Second Paper</a></i></span>
                <p>According to Professor Philip Moriarty from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl-AgmoZ5mo">Sixty Symbols</a> the presentation of data is almost laughable.
                     In the graph above the units on the y-axis are too big to show 0 resistivity of LK-99. 
                     He pointed out how even a &quot;first year physics textbook&quot; would tell you the units should have been 10^-8 cm, not 10^-2 cm. 
                     Furthermore, a superconductor is supposed to have a sudden drop to a resistance of 0 that the graph doesn&#39;t actually show and 
                     instead shows a slow eventual drop to what seems to be 0 indicated by the black squiggly line near the x-axis. 
                     The odd drop-off is already strange but the wrong units are just unacceptable for a paper done by researchers.</p>
                <p>The authors promised to fix the mistakes and claimed better results that proved without a doubt it is a room temperature superconductor but it&#39;s 2025 
                    and their promise has still not materialized. The consensus on this debacle is that they should&#39;ve just had the paper published and gone through peer review. 
                    The answer is always apparently just peer review but why is it so important and would it have prevented LK-99 from happening?</p>
                <h2 id="whats-the-deal-with-peer-review">
                    What&#39;s the Deal with Peer Review?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The common solution that every scientist comes up with when
                    it comes to cases like LK-99 is to just not care about
                    papers until it has been properly peer reviewed and
                    published in some scientific journal. Peer review is always
                    thrown around as the answer and is considered fundamental to
                    the scientific system but surprisingly this process is not
                    as clearly defined as one would think. Generally speaking
                    peer review is where a paper is thoroughly checked and
                    vetted by another scientist working in the same field. The
                    scientist would then say if the paper is indeed good or if
                    it needs edits. Simple right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This definition is on the surface reasonable but there is no
                    clear ruleset for peer review. The matter is instead decided
                    by the journal that would publish the paper. In
                    <a
                        href="https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/editorial-criteria-and-processes"
                        >Nature</a
                    >
                    a well known scientific journal, the editors will first pick
                    the papers that seem to be most intriguing, and then once
                    selected the editor will choose scientists to peer review
                    the paper. There are usually 2-3 reviewers and all of them
                    are volunteers not paid by Nature. The editor gets to make
                    all the decisions regarding who to send it to and the
                    reviewers stay anonymous unless they willingly reveal
                    themselves. After receiving feedback the editor will make a
                    final decision on whether to publish or not. It&#39;s clear
                    that for a process so core to the scientific system it feels
                    oddly unscientific and arbitrary.

                    by Jonathan P. Tennant and Tony Ross-Hellauer there is very
                    little scientific research done on peer review. The paper
                    concludes that many aspects of peer review don&#39;t have
                    enough scientific data to support or undermine them.
                    Worryingly, the paper also points out how peer review often
                    feels like a black box where what exactly happens during
                    peer review is unclear. There are no rulesets for everyone
                    to follow and journals are free to change practically
                    anything they want. The situation worsens as the job of peer
                    review is extremely undervalued and scientists that do the
                    reviews may not have the baseline skills necessary to
                    conduct a proper review.

                <p>In fact, LK-99 may be a demonstration of the issues with the inconsistency of peer review. 
                    According to <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/366/0000920152">Sukbae Lee</a> he did try to publish their findings in 
                    Nature but was required to publish in another specialized journal. 
                    Lee then subsequently had it published in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061">domestic academic journal</a> in April 
                    before the initial uploads to Arxiv. This means that LK-99 did have peer review but it wasn&#39;t able to prevent the event from occurring. 
                    While I am speculating, the shoddy peer review may have given Kwon the confidence to upload that first paper on Arxiv. </p>

                <h2 id="how-do-we-improve">How Do We Improve?</h2>
                <p>I will say peer review is not fundamentally flawed and prestigious journals like Nature do make it work as the papers published are usually high quality. 
                    But that does not mean the process doesn't need reforms. 
                    In fact, the disparity in quality of peer review between journals is a major reason for why it needs change. </p>
                <p>There is this sentiment that I always hear where researchers should only publish to the most prestigious journals because 
                    that is the only way to really get taken seriously by other researchers or organizations. This sucks because it's 
                    just impossible for everyone to get published in these prestigious journals even if the quality of the research may be the same. 
                    I feel that if peer review was disconnected from journals where every journal follows the same core peer review process then I
                     think this sentiment would be far less pervasive and give researchers far more avenues of success.</p>
                <p>The peer review study believes that there needs to be more rigorous research done on peer review. 
                    I agree that peer review should not be put on a pedestal and needs to be an established field of research just like other topics in science.
                     By having good hard research on peer review the black box nature of the process may be lifted.</p>
                <p>These are only some possible changes and other suggestions may be even more effective but my point is that there are significant areas for improvement 
                    in the current established system that should not be ignored. Science is an iterative process and is never finished and that should include the way we conduct science itself. </p>
